When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I need to work in different location / working places
- Other people can colaborate on my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because it can be that the version in my remote repository is less actual than my local one

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you one instead of another.
- Fork: to clone in GitHub a repository, from which I am not a colaborator, but I want to work on in.
- Clone: to create a repository in my computer from a respository in the computer o in GitHub
- Branch: inside of a repository (wherever it is: GitHub or locally) and start a modification
